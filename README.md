This Mad Libs game was developed as a fun project to apply my knowledge of Java and to provide a humorous storytelling experience to users. I hope this project will be both entertaining and a great way to learn about basic Java input/output and string manipulation. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, feedback, or if you just want to talk code!

## Description
The Mad Libs Application is a simple Java-based program designed to generate stories by asking the user to input various parts of speech. This project was developed to demonstrate my understanding of Java basics, like user input handling, string operations, and control flow.

With this application, users can craft unique and often hilarious stories by providing their own words, which the program then incorporates into a pre-defined template. It's a great way to practice parts of speech and have fun with language.

## How to Use
1. Download the Java files from the repository.
2. Compile and run the MadLib.java file.
3. The program will prompt you to choose between a short or a long story.
4. You will then be asked to enter various words (nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.).
5. After all inputs are given, the program will generate your custom Mad Lib story.

## Technologies Used
- The program uses Java's `java.util.Scanner` class for user input.
- Java 1.8
- Eclipse IDE

## Lessons Learned
- User Input Handling: Learning how to use Scanner to get user input.
- String Manipulation: Utilizing string concatenation and manipulation to create a story.
- Control Flow: Using switch statements and loops to control the flow of the program.
- Function Creation: Structuring code into reusable methods for better organization and readability.

## Usage Examples
- Generated Story: "I've got to jump not to worry... Thankfully, it was only looking for its dog and saw silly balloons."
- Generated Story: "You go to a library and see ancient wizards. It decides to vanish them... They were awakened by a library and go on an ancient wizard adventure. I've got to vanish not to worry... Thankfully, it was only looking for its library and saw ancient wizards. You decide to vanish and then it left."
